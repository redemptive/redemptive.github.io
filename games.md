I really like making games.

Mostly Javascript games using the HTML5 canvas element. I like these because I can just use github pages to host them!

Here is what I have:

Space Invaders: [play](https://redemptive.github.io/space-invaders/), [source](https://github.com/redemptive/space-invaders)

It was a lot of fun to make this. Simple javascript/HTML5 canvas browser game recreating the old classic space invaders.

Crafter: [play](https://redemptive.github.io/Crafter/), [source](https://github.com/redemptive/Crafter)

A 2d tile based, minecraft inspired (kind of) game. Craft things, walk around, chop trees and harvest some carrots.
