Hello, my name is Ewan Forbes and I am a DevOps engineer from Edinburgh, Scotland.

Currently living in London, I try to be a `T` shaped person. Wide breath of skills with a specialty.

Well, as a DevOps engineer, my specialty is providing and maintaining secure, robust and cost effective cloud solutions.

Saying that, I have a wide breadth of skills. I also enjoy:
- Creating web apps and APIs with nodejs
- Making browser games with JavaScript
- Games in Python
- Various Rasberry pi projects like a multiplatform arcade, jenkins server, kubernetes node

I will write about all of these, give me some time!
